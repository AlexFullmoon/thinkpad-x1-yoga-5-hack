# Yet another Opencore config for Lenovo Thinkpad X1 Yoga Gen5.

OC 0.9.7 | macOS 13.6.3

## Why isn't there an EFI folder that I can just drop in and use?

You must build it yourself.

I am also not sure if packaging a bunch of outdated precompiled files is right.

## Hardware

| Part        | Model               | How to enable                           |
| ----------- | ------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| CPU         | Comet Lake (10310U) | PluginType is enough                    |
| GPU         | Intel UHD 620       | WhateverGreen with framebuffer patching |
| Ethernet    | Intel i219LM        | IntelMausi. Just works‚Ñ¢                 |
| WiFi        | Intel AX201         | itlwm *or* AirportItlwm                 |
| Audio       | ALC 285             | AppleALC, layout 71, no internal mic    |
| Bluetooth   | Intel AX201         | IntelBluetoothFirmware                  |

| Wacom pen   | USB device          | VoodooI2C, see details in [docs/Input.md](docs/Input.md) |

See [docs/Hardware.md](docs/Hardware.md) for more details.

## üö´ Final issues (won't ever work)

- Usual suspects: fingerprint, IR camera (if present), WWAN (if present).
- Internal microphone.
- [DRM playback](https://github.com/acidanthera/WhateverGreen/blob/master/Manual/FAQ.Chart.md) ‚Äî broken on iGPU.

## ‚ùì Lesser issues

- Wacom pen has limited functionality.
- Fn keys. Most works with YogaSMC and Brightness keys. Some issues remain.
- Yoga conversion detection (i.e. rotate screen and disable keyboard) doesn't work.
  - Unclear. YogaSMC supposed to do this.
- Thunderbolt
  - Controller appears in system and I can hotplug another monitor over TB/DP.
  - Requires further testing, but as I have no hardware to test, it remains an open issue.
- Rare night-time sleep crashes. Hard to debug.
  - Simplest way is disabling hibernation and related features via usual `pmset` litany.
  - Testing with HibernationFixup is planned.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Warnings

Do not use Fn-4 without YogaSMC, it crashes the system.

Resetting NVRAM is reported to **brick** certain Thinkpads with certain BIOS versions. Might be unrelated to this model, but better not to risk that.

## Notes on work in progress

- [ ] Fix remaining keyboard buttons.
- [ ] Fix Yoga conversion ‚Äî if possible.
- [ ] Increase max VRAM?
- [ ] ‚Üí Try to enable hibernation.
- [ ] Final cleaning: removing serial, public repo, etc.

## BIOS settings

[TODO] Recheck

- Config
  - Thunderbolt
    - BIOS Assist mode ‚Üí *Disabled*
    - Thunderbolt Device ‚Üí *Enabled*
  - Sleep mode ‚Üí *Linux*
- Security
  - Security chip ‚Üí *Disabled*
  - Fingerprint predesktop ‚Üí *Disabled*
  - Secure Boot ‚Üí *Disabled*; Clear all keys if needed
  - Intel SGX ‚Üí *Disabled*
- Network
  - WOL ‚Üí *Disabled*
  - UEFI IPv4,IPv6 stack ‚Üí *Disabled*
- Startup
  - CSM Support ‚Üí *Disabled*

There is no CFG lock in BIOS (it's inside engineering menu), and usual ways of switching it (modified GRUB, RU) **do not work**. Reportedly, the only way to toggle it or enable engineering menu is through direct BIOS write, with programmer clip and all, with corresponding dangers (doing that breaks TPM, among other things).

There is no DVMT Prealloc setting (it's inside engineering menu along with CFG Lock), but fortunately it's already 64Mb by default, enough for framebuffer.

## ACPI files

See [docs/ACPI.md](docs/ACPI.md) for more details.

| Name         | What it is                      |
| ------------ | ------------------------------- |
| SSDT-PLUG    | CPU PluginType enabler          |
| SSDT-USBX    | USB power injection             |
| SSDT-PNLF    | Backlight fix                   |
| SSDT-RTCAWAC | RTC fix                         |
| SSDT-RHUB    | USB hub fix                     |
| SSDT-OSI     | OS version patches              |
| SSDT‚ÄëHPET    | IRQ patches                     |
| SSDT-FIXDEV  | Fixes to some devices           |
| SSDT-YOGA    | Supplementary SSDT for YogaSMC  |
| SSDT-TB      | Thunderbolt fixes               |
| SSDT-KEYMAP  | Keyboard remaps. Optional       |
| SSDT-EXTRAS  | Cosmetic device fixes, optional |
| DMAR         | See below. Requires SSDT-FIXDEV |

DMAR is a replacement DMA Regions table with protected regions removed. Basically, macOS is incompatible with VT-d without some fix, and you have three options:

1. Disable VT-d in BIOS. Probably best option if you don't need it in other OSes.
2. Use DisableIOMapper quirk in OC. OC manual recommends this, but there are also reports that next option sometimes work better.
3. Add DMAC device (in SSDT-FIXDEV), remove protected regions in DMAR table and reinject it while dropping original table.

As it could change with BIOS update, **you must make it yourself**, so it is not provided. Use SSDTTime for that.

## Kexts

I am providing UTBMap (USB mapping) and custom-built VoodooI2CHID (see [docs/Input.md](docs/Input.md) for details). For everything else you should grab latest versions.

## Opencore config

Use provided config for reference, follow Dortania guide to build your own for current OpenCore version. Here are some notes:

- ACPI
  - Add all SSDTs, remember to drop DMAR table if using that method.
  - Quirks: none.
- Booter/Quirks
  - `DevirtualiseMmio` is unnecessary.
  - `EnableSafeModeSlide` and thus `ProvideCustomSlide` seems necessary, long boot time if disabled.
- DeviceProperties
  - Audio is at `PciRoot(0x0)/Pci(0x1f,0x3)`.
  - Video is at `PciRoot(0x0)/Pci(0x2,0x0)`, as usual.
- Kernel
  - Kext order: see comments to kext entries in config.
  - Quirks:
    - `AppleXcpmCfgLock` is required, CFG lock cannot be disabled in firmware.
    - `AppleCpuPmCfgLock` is apparently not necessary, though?
    - `CustomSMBIOSGuid` is used for multiboot configuration. If you use only macOS, disable it.
    - `DisableIoMapper` is disabled because I replace DMAR table. See above and [docs/ACPI.md](docs/ACPI.md).
- Misc
  - I use `ScanPolicy` 0x00280F03, which means only NVMe and USB drives and only Apple FS, NTFS and EFI partition.
  - Boot/`LauncherOption` is Full for multiboot configuration. If using only macOS, set to Disabled.
- PlatformInfo
  - `UpdateSMBIOSMode` is Custom for multiboot configuration. If using only macOS, set to Create

Provided configs differ in enabled debug options and boot picker interface.
