# Yet another Opencore config for Lenovo Thinkpad X1 Yoga 5.

OC 1.0.0 | macOS Sonoma 14.5 / Ventura 13.6.7 | BIOS 1.33

Build is considered complete. Should work for X1 Carbon 8, possibly also would be useful for X1 Carbon 7 and X1 Yoga 4.

## Why isn't there an EFI folder that I can just drop in and use?

You must build it yourself.

I am also not sure if packaging a bunch of outdated precompiled files is right.

## üö´ Final issues (won't ever work)

- Fingerprint, IR camera (if present), WWAN (if present).
- Internal microphone.
- [DRM playback](https://github.com/acidanthera/WhateverGreen/blob/master/Manual/FAQ.Chart.md) ‚Äî broken on iGPU.

## ‚ùì Lesser issues

- Wacom pen has limited functionality.
- Fn keys. Most works with YogaSMC and Brightness keys, but several are missing, mostly Windows-only functions.
- Yoga conversion detection (i.e. rotate screen and disable keyboard) doesn't work.
  - Apparently *Thinkpad* Yogas are not supported by YogaSMC.
  - You can manually disable keyboard and touchpad (but not trackpoint, currently).
- Thunderbolt
  - Controller appears in system and I can hotplug another monitor over TB/DP.
  - Requires further testing, but as I have no hardware to test, it remains an open issue.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Warnings

Do not use Fn-4 without YogaSMC, it crashes the system.

Resetting NVRAM is reported to **brick** certain Thinkpads (X1 Extreme 1 and 2?) with certain BIOS versions. Most likely completely unrelated to this model, and other users report no issues, so take this warning as additional disclaimer of warranty. 

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Sonoma notes

1. Sonoma requires specific version of AirportItlwm. Also, version 14.4 and above require yet another version.

2. Installing Sonoma above 14.4 requires setting Misc/Security/SecureBootModel to 'Disabled'. This is required *only* at installation time, and should be set to `Default` afterwards.

## üöß Remaining work

- [ ] Fixing remaining Fn keys ‚Äî if possible.
- [ ] Fixing Yoga conversion ‚Äî if possible. ClamshellMode?
- [ ] Disabling trackpoint along with keyboard/trackpad.

## BIOS settings

*Italics* ‚Äî supposed to work either way, but recommended setting should reduce debugging surface

**Bold** ‚Äî required settings

- Config
  - Network
    - Wake-on-LAN ‚Üí *Disabled*
    - UEFI network stack ‚Üí *Disabled*
  - Power
    - Sleep mode ‚Üí **Linux**
  - Thunderbolt
    - BIOS Assist mode ‚Üí *Disabled* ‚Üì see below
    - Security ‚Üí *Disabled*
    - Thunderbolt Preboot ‚Üí *Disabled*
  - Intel AMT ‚Üí *Disabled* ‚Üì
- Security
  - Fingerprint predesktop ‚Üí *Disabled*
  - Secure Boot ‚Üí **Disabled**; Clear all keys if needed.
  - Virtualization
    - Kernel DMA ‚Üí *Disabled*
    - Vt-d ‚Üí **Disable** this or enable DisableIOMapper quirk. Disabling in BIOS recommended for macOS-only configuration.
    - Enhanced Windows Biometrics ‚Üí **Disabled**
  - IO ports
    - I suggest disabling all devices you won't use. 
    - I.e. disable WWAN (if you even have one), fingerprint if you're going to use only macOS.
  - Intel SGX ‚Üí **Disabled**
  - Device Guard ‚Üí **Disabled**
- Startup
  - UEFI/Legacy ‚Üí **UEFI**
  - CSM Support ‚Üí **Disabled**

There is no CFG lock in BIOS (it's inside engineering menu), and usual ways of switching it (modified GRUB, RU) **do not work**. Reportedly, the only way to toggle it or enable engineering menu is through direct BIOS write, with programmer clip and all, with corresponding dangers (doing that breaks TPM, among other things).

Surprisingly, system boots just fine with both CfgLock quirks disabled. Either something is wrong with ControlMsrE2 utility, or there is some peculiarity with Thinkpad firmware. There are similar reports about T490, see [acidanthera/bugtracker#2355](https://github.com/acidanthera/bugtracker/issues/2355). I didn't test long-term system stability with both quirks off, but disabling AppleCpuPmCfgLock doesn't seem to have any ill effects. 

There is no DVMT Prealloc setting (it's inside engineering menu along with CFG Lock), but fortunately it's already 64Mb by default, enough for framebuffer.

According to one source, setting Thunderbolt / BIOS Assist mode *Enabled* results in Thunderbolt hotplug not working but decreased battery consumption.

Intel AMT is remote admisintration for enterprise. You do not actually turn it off (it's built in CPU, see [1](https://www.reddit.com/r/thinkpad/comments/ae9qsy/permanently_disabled_intel_amt_did_i_fuck_up/) [2](https://libreboot.org/faq.html#intel)), just disable management interface.

Secure boot can theoretically be enabled, as OpenCore has required keys, just unneeded extra trouble to do so.

## Opencore config

Use provided config for reference, follow Dortania guide to build your own for current OpenCore version. Here are some notes:

- ACPI
  - Add all SSDTs, remember to drop DMAR table if using that method.
  - Quirks: none.
- Booter/Quirks
  - `DevirtualiseMmio` is unnecessary.
  - `EnableSafeModeSlide` and thus `ProvideCustomSlide` seems necessary, long boot time if disabled.
- DeviceProperties
  - Audio is at `PciRoot(0x0)/Pci(0x1f,0x3)`.
  - Video is at `PciRoot(0x0)/Pci(0x2,0x0)`, as usual.
- Kernel
  - Kext order: see comments to kext entries in config.
  - Quirks:
    - `AppleXcpmCfgLock` and `AppleCpuPmCfgLock` ‚Äî see BIOS section. You can try disabling both.
    - `CustomSMBIOSGuid` is used for multiboot configuration. If you use only macOS, disable it.
    - `DisableIoMapper` is required unless you disable Vt-d in BIOS. Quirk recommended for multiboot configuration.
- Misc
  - I use `ScanPolicy` 0x00280F03, which means only NVMe and USB drives and only Apple FS, NTFS and EFI partition.
  - Boot/`LauncherOption` is `Full` for multiboot configuration. For installer or when using only macOS, it should be set to `Disabled`.
  - Security/`SecureBootModel` should be set to `Disabled` for installing/updating Sonoma above certain version, and to `Default` for normal use. 
- NVRAM/Bootargs:
  - `rtcfx_exclude=80-AB` ‚Äî required for hibernation.
  - `revpatch=sbvmm` ‚Äî RestrictEvent options, sbvmm is required for system upgrades to Sonoma and above.
  - config_installer also has standard debugging bootargs.
  - Additional UUID E09B... contains HibernationFixup configuration.
- PlatformInfo
  - `UpdateSMBIOSMode` is `Custom` for multiboot configuration. If using only macOS, set to `Create`. Supposedly `Custom` mode is more buggy.
- UEFI/ReservedMemory
  - One region that is apparently required for hibernation.

Provided configs differ mainly in enabled debug options and boot picker interface.
